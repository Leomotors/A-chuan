If you play SEGA's arcade rythm game for example maimai. There will be an option
to show your score in real time (which is basic for all games), but there is
an option called `Score (Type-)` which show your score starting at full score
and decrease as you miss perfect.

So I do the same, but for your score in university courses.

There is also an option in maimai to show how far you are from losing particular
grade, I also made an option to show how far you are from losing A

_work in progress and might be wip forever lol_
